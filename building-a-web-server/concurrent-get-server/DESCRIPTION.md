To enable your server to handle several clients at once, you will introduce concurrency using the [fork](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/fork.2.html) syscall.
When a client connects, [fork](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/fork.2.html) creates a child process dedicated to handling that connection.
Meanwhile, the parent process immediately returns to accept additional connections.
With this design, the child uses [read](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/read.2.html) and [write](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/write.2.html) to interact with the client, while the parent continues to listen.
This concurrent model is a key concept in building scalable, real-world servers.
