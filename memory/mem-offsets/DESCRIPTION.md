So now you can dereference pointers in memory like a pro!
But pointers don't always point directly at the data you need.
Sometimes, for example, a pointer might point to a collection of data (say, an entire book), and you'll need to reference partway into this collection for the specific data you need.

For example, if your pointer (say, `rdi`) points to a sequence of numbers in memory, as so:

```none
  Address | Contents
+--------------------+
| 133700  | 50       |🭮┐
| 133701  | 42       | │
| 133702  | 99       | │
| 133703  | 14       | │
+--------------------+ │
                       │
 Register | Contents   │
+--------------------+ │
| rdi     | 133700   |─┘
+--------------------+
```


If you want the second number of that sequence, you could do:

```assembly
mov rax, [rdi+1]
```

Wow, super simple!
In memory terms, we call these number slots _bytes_: each memory address represents a specific byte of memory.
The above example is accessing memory 1 byte after the memory address pointed to by `rax`.
In memory terms, we call this 1 byte difference an _offset_, so in this example, there is an offset of 1 from the address pointed to by `rdi`.

Let's practice this concept.
As before, we will initialize `rax` (note: not `rdi` unlike the example!) to point at the secret value, but not _directly_ at it.
This time, the secret value will have an offset of 8 bytes from where `rax` points, something analogous to this:

```none
  Address | Contents
+--------------------+
| 31337   | 0        |◂┐
| 31337+1 | 0        | │
| 31337+2 | 0        | │
| 31337+3 | 0        | │
| 31337+4 | 0        | │
| 31337+5 | 0        | │
| 31337+6 | 0        | │
| 31337+7 | 0        | │
| 31337+8 | ???      | │
+--------------------+ │
                       │
 Register | Contents   │
+--------------------+ │
| rdi     | 31337    |─┘
+--------------------+
```

Of course, the actual memory address is not `31337`.
We'll choose it randomly, and store it in `rdi`.
Go dereference `rdi` with offset `8` and get the flag!
