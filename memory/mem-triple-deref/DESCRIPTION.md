Okay, let's stretch that to one more depth!
We've added an additional level of indirection in this challenge, so now you'll need *three* dereferences to find the secret value.
Something like this:

```none
     Address | Contents
   +--------------------+
 ┌─| 133700  | 123400   |🭮──┐
 │ +--------------------+   │
 └🭬| 123400  | 100000   |─┐ │
   +--------------------+ │ │
   | 100000  | 42       |🭮┘ │
   +--------------------+   │
                            │
                            │
    Register | Contents     │
   +--------------------+   │
   | rdi     | 133700   |───┘
   +--------------------+
```

As you can see, we'll place the first address that you must dereference into rax.
Go get the value!
