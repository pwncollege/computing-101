As you write larger and larger programs, you (yes, even you!) might make mistakes when implementing certain functionality, introducing _bugs_ into your programs.
When this happens, you'll need to have a reliable toolbox of resources to understand what is going wrong and fix it.
Of course, the _exact same_ techniques can be used to understand what is wrong with code that you _didn't_ write, and fix or exploit it as you might desire!

This module will introduce you to several ways to introspect, debug, and understand software.
You'll carry this critical knowledge with you and use it throughout pwn.college, so harken well!
