Okay, our previous solution wrote output but then crashed.
In this level, you will write output, and then _not_ crash!

We'll do this by invoking the `write` system call, and then invoking the `exit` system call to cleanly exit the program.
How do we invoke two system calls?
Just like you invoke two instructions!
First, you set up the necessary registers and invoke `write`, then you set up the necessary registers and invoke `exit!

Your previous solution had 5 instructions (setting `rdi`, setting `rsi`, setting `rdx`, setting `rax`, and `syscall`).
This one should have those 5, plus three more for `exit` (setting `rdi` to the exit code, setting `rax` to syscall index `60`, and `syscall`).
For this level, let's exit with exit code `42`!
