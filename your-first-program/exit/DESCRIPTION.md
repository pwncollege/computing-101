So, your first program crashed...
Don't worry, it happens!
In this challenge, you'll learn how to make your program cleanly exit instead of crashing.

Starting your program and cleanly stopping it are actions handled by your computer's _Operating System_.
The operating system manages the existence of programs and interactions between the programs, your hardware, the network environment, and so on.

Your programs "interact" with the CPU using assembly instructions such as the `mov` instruction you wrote earlier.
Similarly, your programs interact with the operating system (via the CPU, of course) using the `syscall`, or _System Call_ instruction.

Like how you might use a phone call to interact with a local restaraunt to order food, programs use system calls to request the operating system to carry out actions on the program's behalf.
As a bit of an overgeneralization, anything your program does that doesn't involve performing computation on data is done with a system call.

There are a lot of different system calls your program can invoke.
For example, Linux has around 330 different ones, though this number changes over time as syscalls are added and deprecated.
Each system call is indicated by a _syscall number_, counting upwards from 0, and your program invokes a specific syscall by moving its syscall number into the `rax` register and invoking the `syscall` instruction.
For example, if we wanted to invoke syscall 42 (a syscall that you'll learn about sometime later!), we would write two instructions:

```assembly
mov rax, 42
syscall
```

Very cool, and super easy!

In this challenge, we'll learn our first syscall: `exit`.
The `exit` syscall causes a program to exit.
By explicitly exiting, we can avoid the crash we ran into with our previous program!

Now, the syscall number of `exit` is `60`.
Go and write your first program: it should move `60` into `rax`, then invoke `syscall` to cleanly exit!
